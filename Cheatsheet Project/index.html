        <h2>Defining Block and Inline</h2>

            <p><span class="definition">Block:</span> Elements that start a new line in the browser. Such as: <span class="tags">&lt;h1&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;</span>
            </p>
             <p><span class="definition">Inline:</span> Elements that continue the same line as their adjacent elements. Such as:<span class="tags"> &lt;a&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;img&gt;</span>
            </p>

        <h2>Display</h2> Allows to turn an inline element to a block element and viceversa<br>

            <p><span class="display">Inline:</span> Block-level element acts like an inline<br>
            </p>
            <p><span class="display">Block:</span> Inline element acts like an block-level<br>
            </p>
            <p><span class="display">Inline-block:</span> Block-level element flows like an inline. Retains other features of a block-level element.<br>
            </p>

        <h2>Position</h2>

            <p><span class="position">Normal Flow:</span> <br>(Default) Block- level elements appear in a new line. Each item appears lower down than the previous one.
            </p>
            <p><span class="position">Relative:</span> <br> Moves an element from the static position it would be in normal flow. Doesn't affect sorrounding elements.
            </p>

            </p>

                <h3>Z-Index: used to overlap elements. Value is a number. The higher the number, the closest is the element to the front
                </h3>

            <p><span class="position">Floating</span> <br> Takes the element out of the normal flow and positions left or right to a container. Other content flows around it. Block-level element.
            </p>

                <h3> Clear: allows that no element should touch the left o right hand sides of a box. Values: left, right, both, none.
